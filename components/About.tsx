    <p key={1}>
      My appreciation for both classic and modern vehicles inspired me to launch this venture at the age of 14. At the time, I was eager to earn my own income but quickly realized that traditional job opportunities were limited for someone my age. Determined to turn my vision into reality, I established my own mobile detailing service - one that prioritizes <Highlight>quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction</Highlight>.
    </p>,
    <p key={2}>
      With the support of friends and family, what started as a small summer job washing cars for neighbors has grown into a <Highlight>thriving business serving a loyal clientele</Highlight>. I take immense pride in delivering meticulous detailing services that help vehicle owners maintain their carsâ€™ pristine appearance.
    </p>,
    <p key={3}>
      As a <Highlight>student entrepreneur</Highlight>, I balance my academic responsibilities with running this business, ensuring that every customer receives top-tier service. My commitment is to provide <Highlight>convenience, reliability, and affordability</Highlight> to busy vehicle owners who value high-quality car care.
